					<p> I recently revamped the blog and started to write consistently — very consistently — to the point I now
						write every single day of the week. I’ve already seen a lot of good results.

						I found my mission in helping developers learn Frontend Development: I release a new tutorial every day on
						my blog flaviocopes.com, explaining all I know about a specific topic. If you are into JavaScript or into
						developing on the Web, don’t miss it!

						Here are my thoughts on blogging, why I think every developer should blog, and blog consistently.

						A few things I want you to forget
						“I am not an expert”
						Anyone has a unique angle, a perspective on something that’s worth sharing. You might think you don’t know
						as much as person X, but person Y might have much less experience than you and would benefit from reading
						your thoughts and learnings.

						Also, the best moment to teach something is right after you’ve learned it, because you remember how not
						knowing about it feels.

						In this case, you can blog with the tone of a student that’s just learned something. I learn new things
						every day. Around 50% of what I end up writing I just learned while researching a topic.

						“I’m not a good writer”
						I’m not either, but I don’t care.

						Just remember: you will never become a good writer unless you practice writing every day for years. You will
						become a good writer, eventually.

						“I fear criticism”
						It’s true that some places on the internet are not afraid to give harsh opinions on things, notoriously
						Reddit and Hacker News — but this is a good thing.

						Remember, you’re not growing if you’re not challenged. Also, you’re not required to post there if you don’t
						want to. Do you worry about someone making a mean comment on a post that’s controversial? Remove comments
						altogether.

						Why writing is great for a developer

						You learn much faster
						One of ways I learn best is by doing. I literally decide on a topic I think I know something about, and I
						drill down in a spiral loop through things I didn’t know, or I didn’t even think about.

						They say you never fully understand a topic until you are able to explain it. Blogging is a low barrier to
						explaining things.

						Kick start your career
						I’ve kick started my career in software thanks to a blog.

						It was 2007, and I’d started sharing little things I was learning while building a few web applications as
						part of my university program.

						Through this blog, I got a lot of connections and leads for an upcoming freelance and contractor career.

						That old blog has since died off — I stopped writing on it a long time ago and the content, now completely
						outdated, is long gone. But without it, I think I would have never imagined opening my own business right
						out of school.

						Switch gears or technology stack
						I did this a few times with my blog writing. If I am into one kind of technology stack, and I find myself
						interested in something else, I write several posts about it.

						For example, last summer I got deep into Go programming for two months. And I literally had recruiters
						sending me job offers I’d never applied to, just because they found my posts shared online.

						Some key aspects of a successful technical blog

						Be consistent with the topic
						I never subscribe to feeds of blogs that are not focused on something. In my case I talk Frontend
						Development, and I subscribe to other frontend development blogs.

						And even though I talked a lot about Go last summer, it was still interesting to frontend developers as well
						(learn Go if you have a chance, it’s refreshing). Don’t just rant about everything that comes to mind. Keep
						it professional.

						Show up consistently
						If you set out to write a blog post every week, do it. Twice a week, much better. I write every day, because
						I know that if I allow some day to slip by, I will allow myself to skip another day, and so on until I won’t
						post any more.

						Write posts in advance
						Don’t write the blog post the day you want to publish it. Write it one week in advance, or more. You are
						less likely to miss a blog post day even if you take a few days off, or you’re sick.

						It’s also a good idea to publish them in advance. WordPress makes it very easy, and it’s doable also with
						static blogs (here’s how I do it with Netlify and Hugo). Schedule a specific time and day to write,
						consistently.</p>

					<pre>
					    <code>
function $initHighlight(block, cls) {
  try {
    if (cls.search(/\bno\-highlight\b/) != -1)
      return process(block, true, 0x0F) +
             ` class="${cls}"`;
  } catch (e) {
    /* handle exception */
  }
  for (var i = 0 / 2; i < classes.length; i++) {
    if (checkCondition(classes[i]) === undefined)
      console.log('undefined');
  }
}

export  $initHighlight;
